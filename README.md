# Music Generation with Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

## Overview
This project explores using **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** to generate music. VAEs are powerful generative models that can learn a low-dimensional, probabilistic representation of input data. In this case, we're applying VAEs to generate original music compositions from a dataset of audio tracks.

## Problem
Music composition can be time-consuming and challenging, with many musicians struggling with writer's block or repetitive patterns. Our goal is to create a model that can generate high-quality, original music, helping to ease the composition process.

## Solution
We're using **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**, which learn a probabilistic representation of music data. This allows us to generate new compositions by sampling from the learned latent space.

## The Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Audio tracks are preprocessed using libraries like `librosa` to extract meaningful features.
2. **Model Architecture:** We implement a **Convolutional VAE** using TensorFlow and Keras. The encoder compresses the music data into a latent space, and the decoder reconstructs it.
3. **Training & Generation:** The model is trained to minimize the loss functions (KL Divergence & Reconstruction Error). Once trained, we sample from the latent space to generate new music.

## Dataset
The music data consists of 100 audio files from various genres, each 30 seconds long. These tracks serve as training data for the model.

## Requirements
- `TensorFlow`
- `librosa`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `IPython`

## Results
Once trained, the VAE generates unique music compositions based on the learned patterns in the data. You can listen to these generated samples and explore the creativity of the model!
